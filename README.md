Custom Operating System (OS) Project
Welcome to the Custom OS project, a minimalist operating system developed from scratch as an educational endeavor into low-level system programming and OS fundamentals.

Key Features:
Bootloader: Manages the initial boot process, essential for loading the OS kernel.

Kernel: Basic monolithic kernel with interrupt handling for system operations.

Memory Management: Implements simple paging and memory allocation strategies.

Basic Drivers: Supports keyboard and screen input-output for text-based interactions.

Shell: Provides a minimal command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Technologies Used:
Languages: Primarily C for kernel development, complemented by Assembly for boot and bare-metal components.

Tools: Utilizes GCC for compilation, NASM for assembly programming, QEMU for emulation, and Make for build automation.
